# About the Dynamics 365 partner community on Viva Engage (formerly Yammer)

The partner community on Viva Engage is your unique opportunity as a customer or partner to stay up to date on what's going on in the Finance and Operations apps engineering teams. We regularly post updates on everything from major and minor updates to events, webinars and other "good to know" things. We have many subgroups you can join on topics such as "App Development", "Onboarding", "Copilot and AI automation", "Docs and training" and more. You can reach out and ask questions directly to the subject matter experts in these subgroups in the partner community. 

## The Finance and Operations Preview program

The Preview program for Finance and Operation is no longer managed through the Experience Dynamics 365 Insider Program. Customers do not need to onboard the Insider Program in order to be part of the Preview community on Viva Engage.

Customers should join the Viva Engage Preview Early Access group to receive updates on the Preview program and interact with the product team and other customers about the coming release.

## Private feature groups

When you are a part of the Preview Early Access group, the product team will be able to onboard you to Viva Engage groups that are private and targeted a specific private feature or feature area. Approvals and onboarding for these groups are managed by the product group program managers responsible for the feature area.

## Know issue for EU customers

Some customers in the EU are unable to join our Yammer network using their company email. For these customers, the recommended workaround is to create an outlook, gmail, etc., account and then repeat the join request with this account.
